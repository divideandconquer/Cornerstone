# Documentation
This folder is for placing any module or application specific documentation. Since this
file will automatically display when you view the folder from the GitHub web page,
it should be used as a high level table of contents and collation of feature sets.

An off the top of my head list of topics that would be good:

## General Documentation
* Getting Started
* Configuration
Event Manager
Routing
Logging
Exception Handling

## Http MVC Documentation
* Navigation
* Adding New Controllers
* Adding Views
* Updating the Layout
* View Strategies

## Console MVC Documentation</h4>
* Getting Started
* Usage
* Listeners
* Adding New Commands
